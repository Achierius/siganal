For a long time, people in the Great Thing voted as they saw fit. If ttheir home farmed wheat, they would try to lower the wheat tax; if they were coastal, they'd try to lower the sea-levy. Yet this always had its problems: you could never find enough people who wanted to lower the wheat tax to lower the wheat tax, nor enough people who farmed barley to lower the barley tax. One didn't affect the other directly, so the voters for one never wanted to vote for the other!
